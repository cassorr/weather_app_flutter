- Entry point of the Flutter app.
- Loads environment variables, initializes Firebase, and launches the `MenuView`.

### `lib/test.dart`
- Used for manually testing the weather API and saving the data to Firebase Firestore.
- Initializes Firebase and fetches real-time data for a hardcoded city (`Missoula`).

## Environment Configuration

### `.env.example`
This file is included as a **template** for your environment variables.

**Why?**  
My actual `.env` file contains sensitive info like API key and Firebase credentials.

Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, then fill in your actual secrets:
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
